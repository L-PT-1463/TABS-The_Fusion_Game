# TABS-The_Fusion_Game

Description:

"TABS - The Fusion Game" is a custom gamemode/ruleset designed for Totally Accurate Battle Simulator's (TABS) sandbox mode. It offers a way to play between players with set rules and allows you to define a winner. It s based on unit fusions and dynamic progression through the factions, itself being based on fusions to work.

The Guide will, once it is created, give you easy access to all the rules. It'll include an easy-to-understand manual, featuring interactive menus for fusion recipes and faction unlockings. Players can easily navigate through the manual to learn the rules and mechanics of the gamemode. Notably when you win points, or "victories", or when you unlock factions. Both of which you can keep track of using the Scoreboard.

Here is the entire ruleset while you wait for a proper rulebook:

TABS - The Fusion Game

Rules :
 Both players start with a clubber that can be placed anywhere on the map and only have access to the Tribal faction
 Every turn, each player has 1 action, with the loser getting an additional action. Every 15 total victories, both players get an additional action, and every 30 the losing player gets an additional 1. The actions are :
	- Placing a Tier 1 unit
	- Fusing a group of units (to create new unit or to unlock a faction)
	- Changing placement of the army : When using this action, up to 5 units you own can be moved.
		(note that once placed, units cannot be removed, only moved or fused)
 In order to make the game faster and easier, next to every unit is written [in brakcets] the amount of actions required to make it from T1s (as in cost of placing the units and of all fusions required to get it), assuming you have all factions unlocked, and every factions includes the raw price for unlocking a new faction with it

 This game is based on evolution and fusions. There are five tiers of units per faction*. The "objective" is to progress trough the factions and discover new units. 1 to 3 units per faction are considered Tier 1 (T1 for short). These units are "fused" into stronger units accordingly to predefined recipes. To fuse a unit you simply delete a group of *nearby* units (max. distance = 1 Halfling) you can then place the new unit anywhere within the bondaries of where the previous units were.
*T1 units are free, T2 and T3 always include at least one unit, T4 doesn't always have units, T5 always has exactly one unit.
		(note that a units Tier is defined semi-arbitralrily and you are not forced to have all of a faction's units of a Tier in order to fuse something of a higher Tier)

 In order to unlock a faction you must first have gotten all the T2 units of the last faction you unlocked (at the start, it is the Tribal faction) once that is done, the player may fuse all of the T1s of that faction into the first unit of the new desired faction, thus unlocking it. This process can only be done once per faction, so choose wisely.
	e.g. : Unlocking Renaissance with Tribal - If you have (or had at some point) a Chieftan and a Stoner, you can fuse a Protector, a Clubber and a Spearthrower into a Painter
 Players are free to unlock any faction desired, from the Farmer to the Spooky factions. Once at least 4 factions (excluding Tribal) have been unlocked, the player automatically unlocks the "Wild West" faction. The former can only unlock either the Fantasy Good or Fantasy Evil faction. Once a player has unlocked one of the two, the opponent is forced to take the other once he can/wishes to.
 		(note that Legacy and Secret factions are not used)
_____________________________________

	How to win :

 - Once both T5s of the Fantasy Good and Fanatasy Evil factions have been placed, the game will enter a Final Battle. The players are allowed to do a final set a ctions, getting both an additional 5 actions. The Final Battle is worth 5 victories. The player with the most victories after the Final Battle wins the game.

		or

 - Once both players have unlocked the Quick Draw unit, the game will enter a Final Battle. The players are allowed to do a final set a ctions, getting both an additional 3 actions. The Final Battle is worth 3 victories. The player with the most victories after the Final Battle wins the game.
		(note that this victory condition can therefore disable the F. Good and F. Evil factions, if the players wish)

		and/or

 - First player to win X amount of times wins the game.
		(note that this victory condition can therefore disable the F. Good and F. Evil factions, if the players wish)

	In any game :
 - Making a Tier 5 unit awards 1 victory to the player that made it.

_____________________________________

The fusions try to be as price equal as possible.
Most of the fusions are symbolic (e.g.: 3x Sarissas in the Longship recipe to represent the 3 vikings wielding the oars on the Longship). Here are a few of the most common uses :
	
	Protector 			- Wooden structure 
	Protector / Shield bearer	- Shield
	Bard / Bone mage		- Magic
	Snake archer			- Animal/Beast
	Squire				- Sword
	Fencer				- Agility/Dodge
	Flintlock			- Gun
	Cheapest T1			- Respective faction (e.g.: every archer variant)
